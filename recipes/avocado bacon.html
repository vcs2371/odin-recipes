    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Cook the penne on the stove in a large pot of water. Usually, that’s around 10 minutes. 
                Check the recommended time on the package directions. Make sure not to overcook it. 
                You want the noodles to be al dente and have some bite. Save a half-cup pasta cooking water.</li>
            <li>Heat the olive oil in a large skillet and sauté the garlic and seasonings.</li> 
            <li>Stir the tomatoes into the garlic and oil and continue cooking for a couple minutes.</li> 
            <li>Fold the cooked pasta into the tomatoes and stir everything together.</li> 
            <li>Pour in the reserved pasta cooking water.  It will bubble and quickly disappear, 
                but as you stir the pasta and tomatoes, it will leave a silky coating with the
                oil on the pasta.</li> 
            <li>Stir in the Parmesan cheese and arugula. 
                The greens will look like a lot in the skillet, but they will quickly wilt.</li>
            <li>Garnish with parsley and more Parmesan before serving.</li>        
        </ol>
