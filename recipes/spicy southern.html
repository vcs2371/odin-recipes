        <h1>Spicy Southern Hot Corn</h1>
          <p>Ok seriously, just writing up this post has me dying to reheat the last cup of leftover hot corn. I made it early so I could snap some photos for this post, but I’m not allowed to eat another bite of of the creamy, spicy deliciousness because I promised it to Paul already.
            Hmmm… Maybe I’ll eat it and then make it again tonight before he gets home tonight… YES!
            Spicy southern hot corn for everyone!</p>
