            <li>1 medium red bell pepper , sliced</li>
            <li>2 carrots , julienned</li>
            <li>1-2 cups snow peas , ends trimmed if desired</li>
            <li>1 cup chopped broccoli</li>
            <li>2-3 oz uncooked ramen noodles</li>
            <li>1-2 tsp sesame oil for sautéing</li>
            <li>2-3 TBSP sliced green onion for topping</li>
            <li>Sriracha or chili garlic sauce, for topping (optional)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>STIR FRY SAUCE</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>3-4 cloves garlic (smashed, peeled, and minced)</li>
            <li>1/2 lemon , juiced</li>
            <li>1/4 cup soy sauce</li>
            <li>3 TBSP sweet chili sauce</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp crushed red pepper flakes</li>
            <li>1 tsp cornstarch</li>
            <li>1 tsp cold water</li>
         </ul>

         <h2>INSTRUCTIONS</h2>

         <ol>
            <li>Clean and peel fresh raw shrimp. Thaw first if using frozen. 
                Tails may be left on or off based on preference. Any size works here; simply adjust cook time 
                to compliement shrimp size.</li>
                <li>Prep veggies. I always suggest slicing carrots and bell peppers thin for faster cooking, 
                    and also chopping broccoli into small bites. Snow peas can be kept whole or cut in half.</li>
                <li>Next mix up the sauce. Combine minced garlic with lemon juice, soy sauce, sweet chili sauce, and crushed red pepper flakes. 
                    Whisk and set aside. In a small separate bowl, stir together corn starch and water.</li>    
                <li>Now that the prepwork is done, this dish will come togehter quick!</li>    
                <li>Cook noodles via package instructions in boiling water, approx. 3-4 minutes.
                     Drain and rinse with cold water. Set aside.</li>
                <li>Heat a large wok or skillet to medium-high heat with sesame oil. Add veggies and stir fry for 2 minutes for still-crisp veggies
                     or a few extra minutes for more tender vegetables.</li>     
                <li>Add shrimp to the vegetables. Add sauce and cook for 2-3 minutes or until shrimp are visibly opaque/curled and cooked through. Add corn starch and cook for an additional minute to thicken the sauce. Alternatively, if your pan seems a bit crowded, 
                    the shrimp can be cooked on their own in a separate skillet then added to the dish at the end.</li> 
                    Add ramen noodles and mix well. Adjust spices/sauce to taste if needed. Top with chopped green onion and 
                    drizzle with sriracha or chili sauce if desired <— always a must for me! Enjoy!     
        </ol>
