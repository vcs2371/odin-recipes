# odin-recipes

First offical odin project. 
A simple recipe page.

A great project to see and learn how basic html comes together to complete the bones of the pages.

Became a much better git user. 
Working/ learning my way through directories using terminal. 
Adding multiple pages to increase difficulty. Reasoning is to create difficulty and making sure I keep up on organizing pages.
